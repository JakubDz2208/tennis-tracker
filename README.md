# Object Detection Documentation

This documentation provides an overview of the object detection problem in the context of a tennis match.

## Project Description

The object detection project aims to track and detect tennis balls and give a segment mask of the tennis court in a given video or image. It utilizes computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms, specifically the pre-trained YOLOV8 models, to identify and track the tennis balls' positions and predict collision with the tennis court.

## Installation

To run the project, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow
- NumPy

You can install the required dependencies by running the following command:
``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```
